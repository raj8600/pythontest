#Assignment
#Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
# Ask the user for the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Ask the user for the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the multiplication and sum
multiplication = num1 * num2
sum = num1 + num2

# Print the results
print("The multiplication of", num1, "and", num2, "is", multiplication)
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)


#Output-
#Enter the first number: 80
#Enter the second number: 40
#The multiplication of 80.0 and 40.0 is 3200.0
#The sum of 80.0 and 40.0 is 120.0
